The btcd Bitcoin client (versions 0.10 to 0.24) did not correctly re-implement Bitcoin Core's ""FindAndDelete()"" functionality. This logic is consensus-critical: the difference in behavior with the other Bitcoin clients can lead to btcd clients accepting an invalid Bitcoin block (or rejecting a valid one). This consensus failure can be leveraged to cause a chain split (accepting an invalid Bitcoin block) or be exploited to DoS the btcd nodes (rejecting a valid Bitcoin block). An attacker can create a standard transaction where FindAndDelete doesn't return a match but removeOpCodeByData does making btcd get a different sighash, leading to a chain split. Importantly, this vulnerability can be exploited remotely by any Bitcoin user and does not require any hash power. This is because the difference in behavior can be triggered by a ""standard"" Bitcoin transaction, that is a transaction which gets relayed through the P2P network before it gets included in a Bitcoin block. `removeOpcodeByData(script []byte, dataToRemove []byte)` removes any data pushes from `script` that contain `dataToRemove`. However, `FindAndDelete` only removes exact matches. So for example, with `script = ""<data> <data||foo>""` and `dataToRemove = ""data""` btcd will remove both data pushes but Bitcoin Core's `FindAndDelete` only removes the first `<data>` push.

The btcd Bitcoin client (versions 0.10 to 0.24) did not correctly re-implement Bitcoin Core's ""FindAndDelete()"" functionality. This logic is consensus-critical: the difference in behavior with the other Bitcoin clients can lead to btcd clients accepting an invalid Bitcoin block (or rejecting a valid one). This consensus failure can be leveraged to cause a chain split (accepting an invalid Bitcoin block) or be exploited to DoS the btcd nodes (rejecting a valid Bitcoin block). An attacker can create a standard transaction where FindAndDelete doesn't return a match but removeOpCodeByData does making btcd get a different sighash, leading to a chain split. Importantly, this vulnerability can be exploited remotely by any Bitcoin user and does not require any hash power. This is because the difference in behavior can be triggered by a ""standard"" Bitcoin transaction, that is a transaction which gets relayed through the P2P network before it gets included in a Bitcoin block. `removeOpcodeByData(script []byte, dataToRemove []byte)` removes any data pushes from `script` that contain `dataToRemove`. However, `FindAndDelete` only removes exact matches. So for example, with `script = ""<data> <data||foo>""` and `dataToRemove = ""data""` btcd will remove both data pushes but Bitcoin Core's `FindAndDelete` only removes the first `<data>` push.

This is a **data validation vulnerability** affecting several Gradio components, which allows arbitrary file leaks through the post-processing step. Attackers can exploit these components by crafting requests that bypass expected input constraints. This issue could lead to sensitive files being exposed to unauthorized users, especially when combined with other vulnerabilities, such as issue TOB-GRADIO-15. The components most at risk are those that return or handle file data. Vulnerable Components: 1. **String to FileData:** DownloadButton, Audio, ImageEditor, Video, Model3D, File, UploadButton. 2. **Complex data to FileData:** Chatbot, MultimodalTextbox. 3. **Direct file read in preprocess:** Code. 4. **Dictionary converted to FileData:** ParamViewer, Dataset. Exploit Scenarios: 1. A developer creates a Dropdown list that passes values to a DownloadButton. An attacker bypasses the allowed inputs, sends an arbitrary file path (like `/etc/passwd`), and downloads sensitive files. 2. An attacker crafts a malicious payload in a ParamViewer component, leaking sensitive files from a server through the arbitrary file leak. This issue has been resolved in `gradio>5.0`.
