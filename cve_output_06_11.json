        "description": "Gitsign is a keyless Sigstore to signing tool for Git commits with your a GitHub / OIDC identity. gitsign may select the wrong Rekor entry to use during online verification when multiple entries are returned by the log. gitsign uses Rekor's search API to fetch entries that apply to a signature being verified. The parameters used for the search are the public key and the payload. The search API returns entries that match either condition rather than both. When gitsign's credential cache is used, there can be multiple entries that use the same ephemeral keypair / signing certificate. As gitsign assumes both conditions are matched by Rekor, there is no additional validation that the entry's hash matches the payload being verified, meaning that the wrong entry can be used to successfully pass verification. Impact is minimal as while gitsign does not match the payload against the entry, it does ensure that the certificate matches. This would need to be exploited during the certificate validity window (10 minutes) by the key holder.",

        "description": "SuiteCRM is an open-source, enterprise-ready Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software application. The \"Publish Key\" field in SuiteCRM's Edit Profile page is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code. This can be exploited to steal CSRF tokens and perform unauthorized actions, such as creating new administrative users without proper authentication. The vulnerability arises due to insufficient input validation and sanitization of the Publish Key field within the SuiteCRM application. When an attacker injects a malicious script, it gets executed within the context of an authenticated user's session. The injected script (o.js) then leverages the captured CSRF token to forge requests that create new administrative users, effectively compromising the integrity and security of the CRM instance. This issue has been addressed in versions 7.14.6 and 8.7.1. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",

An attacker who successfully talked a victim into clicking on a specially crafted login link, or a malicious app running on a victim's computer triggering the application key workflow with specially crafted parameters and then redirecting the victim to the related standalone confirmation dialog could use this to retrieve or modify sensitive configuration settings, interrupt prints or otherwise interact with the OctoPrint instance in a malicious way. The above mentioned specific vulnerabilities of the login dialog and the standalone application key confirmation dialog have been patched in the bugfix release 1.10.3 by individual escaping of the detected locations. A global change throughout all of OctoPrint's templating system with the upcoming 1.11.0 release will handle this further, switching to globally enforced automatic escaping and thus reducing the attack surface in general. The latter will also improve the security of third party plugins. During a transition period, third party plugins will be able to opt into the automatic escaping. With OctoPrint 1.13.0, automatic escaping will be switched over to be enforced even for third party plugins, unless they explicitly opt-out.",

These helper functions are\nguaranteed to work expectedly by the KUnit tests, however their application\nincludes a mistake to assign invalid value to the index of port connected\nto parent device.\n\nThis bug affects the case that any extra node devices which has three or\nmore ports are connected to 1394 OHCI controller. In the case, the path\nto update the tree cache could hits WARN_ON(), and gets general protection\nfault due to the access to invalid address computed by the invalid value.\n\nThis commit fixes the bug to assign correct port index.",

        "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nnfsd: fix race between laundromat and free_stateid\n\nThere is a race between laundromat handling of revoked delegations\nand a client sending free_stateid operation. Laundromat thread\nfinds that delegation has expired and needs to be revoked so it\nmarks the delegation stid revoked and it puts it on a reaper list\nbut then it unlock the state lock and the actual delegation revocation\nhappens without the lock. Once the stid is marked revoked a racing\nfree_stateid processing thread does the following (1) it calls\nlist_del_init() which removes it from the reaper list and (2) frees\nthe delegation stid structure. The laundromat thread ends up not\ncalling the revoke_delegation() function for this particular delegation\nbut that means it will no release the lock lease that exists on\nthe file.\n\nNow, a new open for this file comes in and ends up finding that\nlease list isn't empty and calls nfsd_breaker_owns_lease() which ends\nup trying to derefence a freed delegation stateid. Leading to the\nfollowint use-after-free KASAN warning:\n\nkernel: ==================================================================\nkernel: BUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in nfsd_breaker_owns_lease+0x140/0x160 [nfsd]\nkernel: Read of size 8 at addr ffff0000e73cd0c8 by task nfsd/6205\nkernel:\nkernel: CPU: 2 UID: 0 PID: 6205 Comm: nfsd Kdump: loaded Not tainted 6.11.0-rc7+ #9\nkernel: Hardware name: Apple Inc.

Then, coordinating whether the stid has been put\non the cl_revoked list or we are processing FREE_STATEID and need to\nmake sure to remove it from the list, each check that state and act\naccordingly. If laundromat has added to the cl_revoke list before\nthe arrival of FREE_STATEID, then nfsd4_free_stateid() knows to remove\nit from the list. If nfsd4_free_stateid() finds that operations arrived\nbefore laundromat has placed it on cl_revoke list, it marks the state\nfreed and then laundromat will no longer add it to the list.\n\nAlso, for nfsd4_delegreturn() when looking for the specified stid,\nwe need to access stid that are marked removed or freeable, it means\nthe laundromat has started processing it but hasn't finished and this\ndelegreturn needs to return nfserr_deleg_revoked and not\nnfserr_bad_stateid. The latter will not trigger a FREE_STATEID and the\nlack of it will leave this stid on the cl_revoked list indefinitely.",

And so using just the high bit to decide\nwhether an access is in user space or kernel space ends up with the good\nold \"leak speculative data\" if you have the right gadget using the\nresult:\n\n  CVE-2020-12965 \u201cTransient Execution of Non-Canonical Accesses\u201c\n\nNow, the kernel surrounds the access with a STAC/CLAC pair, and those\ninstructions end up serializing execution on older Zen architectures,\nwhich closes the speculation window.\n\nBut that was true only up until Zen 5, which renames the AC bit [1].\nThat improves performance of STAC/CLAC a lot, but also means that the\nspeculation window is now open.\n\nNote that this affects not just the new address masking, but also the\nregular valid_user_address() check used by access_ok(), and the asm\nversion of the sign bit check in the get_user() helpers.\n\nIt does not affect put_user() or clear_user() variants, since there's no\nspeculative result to be used in a gadget for those operations.",

It turns out that the problems are caused by a subtle\ndifference between the timer_pending() and hrtimer_active() APIs.\n\nThe changeover blindly replaced the first by the second.  However,\ntimer_pending() returns True when the timer is queued but not when its\ncallback is running, whereas hrtimer_active() returns True when the\nhrtimer is queued _or_ its callback is running.  This difference\noccasionally caused dummy_urb_enqueue() to think that the callback\nroutine had not yet started when in fact it was almost finished.  As a\nresult the hrtimer was not restarted, which made it impossible for the\ndriver to dequeue later the URB that was just enqueued.  This caused\nusb_kill_urb() to hang, and things got worse from there.\n\nSince hrtimers have no API for telling when they are queued and the\ncallback isn't running, the driver must keep track of this for itself.\nThat's what this patch does, adding a new \"timer_pending\" flag and\nsetting or clearing it at the appropriate times.",

        "description": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\narm64: probes: Remove broken LDR (literal) uprobe support\n\nThe simulate_ldr_literal() and simulate_ldrsw_literal() functions are\nunsafe to use for uprobes. Both functions were originally written for\nuse with kprobes, and access memory with plain C accesses. When uprobes\nwas added, these were reused unmodified even though they cannot safely\naccess user memory.\n\nThere are three key problems:\n\n1) The plain C accesses do not have corresponding extable entries, and\n   thus if they encounter a fault the kernel will treat these as\n   unintentional accesses to user memory, resulting in a BUG() which\n   will kill the kernel thread, and likely lead to further issues (e.g.\n   lockup or panic()).\n\n2) The plain C accesses are subject to HW PAN and SW PAN, and so when\n   either is in use, any attempt to simulate an access to user memory\n   will fault. Thus neither simulate_ldr_literal() nor\n   simulate_ldrsw_literal() can do anything useful when simulating a\n   user instruction on any system with HW PAN or SW PAN.\n\n3) The plain C accesses are privileged, as they run in kernel context,\n   and in practice can access a small range of kernel virtual addresses.\n   The instructions they simulate have a range of +/-1MiB, and since the\n   simulated instructions must itself be a user instructions in the\n   TTBR0 address range, these can address the final 1MiB of the TTBR1\n   acddress range by wrapping downwards from an address in the first\n   1MiB of the TTBR0 address range.\n\n   In contemporary kernels the last 8MiB of TTBR1 address range is\n   reserved, and accesses to this will always fault, meaning this is no\n   worse than (1).\n\n   Historically, it was theoretically possible for the linear map or\n   vmemmap to spill into the final 8MiB of the TTBR1 address range, but\n   in practice this is extremely unlikely to occur as this would\n   require either:\n\n   * Having enough physical memory to fill the entire linear map all the\n     way to the final 1MiB of the TTBR1 address range.\n\n   * Getting unlucky with KASLR randomization of the linear map such\n     that the populated region happens to overlap with the last 1MiB of\n     the TTBR address range.\n\n   ... and in either case if we were to spill into the final page there\n   would be larger problems as the final page would alias with error\n   pointers.\n\nPractically speaking, (1) and (2) are the big issues. Given there have\nbeen no reports of problems since the broken code was introduced, it\nappears that no-one is relying on probing these instructions with\nuprobes.\n\nAvoid these issues by not allowing uprobes on LDR (literal) and LDRSW\n(literal), limiting the use of simulate_ldr_literal() and\nsimulate_ldrsw_literal() to kprobes. Attempts to place uprobes on LDR\n(literal) and LDRSW (literal) will be rejected as\narm_probe_decode_insn() will return INSN_REJECTED. In future we can\nconsider introducing working uprobes support for these instructions, but\nthis will require more significant work.",
