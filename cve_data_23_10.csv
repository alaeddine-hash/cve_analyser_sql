This vulnerability relates to the **bypass of directory traversal checks** within the `is_in_or_equal` function. This function, intended to check if a file resides within a given directory, can be bypassed with certain payloads that manipulate file paths using `..` (parent directory) sequences. Attackers could potentially access restricted files if they are able to exploit this flaw, although the difficulty is high. This primarily impacts users relying on Gradio’s blocklist or directory access validation, particularly when handling file uploads. Users are advised to upgrade to `gradio>=5.0` to address this issue. As a workaround, users can manually sanitize and normalize file paths in their Gradio deployment before passing them to the `is_in_or_equal` function. Ensuring that all file paths are properly resolved and absolute can help mitigate the bypass vulnerabilities caused by the improper handling of `..` sequences or malformed paths.",6.5,CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N,0.0,,"[{""source"": ""security-advisories@github.com"", ""type"": ""Primary"", ""description"": [{""lang"": ""en"", ""value"": ""CWE-22""}]}]","[{""nodes"": [{""operator"": ""OR"", ""negate"": false, ""cpeMatch"": [{""vulnerable"": true, ""criteria"": ""cpe:2.3:a:gradio_project:gradio:*:*:*:*:*:python:*:*"", ""versionEndExcluding"": ""5.0.0"", ""matchCriteriaId"": ""32D191C7-095C-427B-832D-C63FE4D4A037""}]}]}]","[{""url"": ""https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/security/advisories/GHSA-77xq-6g77-h274"", ""source"": ""security-advisories@github.com"", ""tags"": [""Third Party Advisory""]}]","['Windows', 'Linux', 'macOS']",,Gradio,server,"{'AV': {'value': 'N', 'assessment': 'Appropriate', 'llm_value': '', 'remarks': 'The attack vector is network-based, which is appropriate as the vulnerability can be exploited remotely through file uploads.', 'Justification': 'cve_description'}, 'AC': {'value': 'L', 'assessment': 'Inappropriate', 'llm_value': 'H', 'remarks': 'The attack complexity is low in the CVSS vector, but the description states that the difficulty is high, indicating that exploiting this vulnerability may require specific knowledge or conditions.', 'Justification': 'cve_description'}, 'PR': {'value': 'N', 'assessment': 'Appropriate', 'llm_value': '', 'remarks': 'No privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability, which aligns with the description stating that attackers can exploit the flaw without authentication.', 'Justification': 'cve_description'}, 'UI': {'value': 'N', 'assessment': 'Appropriate', 'llm_value': '', 'remarks': 'User interaction is not required to exploit this vulnerability, as attackers can exploit it directly through file uploads.', 'Justification': 'cve_description'}, 'S': {'value': 'U', 'assessment': 'Appropriate', 'llm_value': '', 'remarks': 'The scope is unchanged, which is appropriate since the vulnerability does not affect other components beyond the vulnerable function.', 'Justification': 'cve_description'}}","{'contexts': [{'environment': 'Server-side deployment of Gradio', 'explanation': 'The vulnerability is primarily exploitable in server-side environments where Gradio is used to handle file uploads.
