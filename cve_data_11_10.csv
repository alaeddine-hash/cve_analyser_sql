The btcd Bitcoin client (versions 0.10 to 0.24) did not correctly re-implement Bitcoin Core's ""FindAndDelete()"" functionality. This logic is consensus-critical: the difference in behavior with the other Bitcoin clients can lead to btcd clients accepting an invalid Bitcoin block (or rejecting a valid one). This consensus failure can be leveraged to cause a chain split (accepting an invalid Bitcoin block) or be exploited to DoS the btcd nodes (rejecting a valid Bitcoin block). An attacker can create a standard transaction where FindAndDelete doesn't return a match but removeOpCodeByData does making btcd get a different sighash, leading to a chain split. Importantly, this vulnerability can be exploited remotely by any Bitcoin user and does not require any hash power. This is because the difference in behavior can be triggered by a ""standard"" Bitcoin transaction, that is a transaction which gets relayed through the P2P network before it gets included in a Bitcoin block. `removeOpcodeByData(script []byte, dataToRemove []byte)` removes any data pushes from `script` that contain `dataToRemove`. However, `FindAndDelete` only removes exact matches. So for example, with `script = ""<data> <data||foo>""` and `dataToRemove = ""data""` btcd will remove both data pushes but Bitcoin Core's `FindAndDelete` only removes the first `<data>` push.

This vulnerability relates to **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)** in the `/queue/join` endpoint. Gradio’s `async_save_url_to_cache` function allows attackers to force the Gradio server to send HTTP requests to user-controlled URLs. This could enable attackers to target internal servers or services within a local network and possibly exfiltrate data or cause unwanted internal requests. Additionally, the content from these URLs is stored locally, making it easier for attackers to upload potentially malicious files to the server. This impacts users deploying Gradio servers that use components like the Video component which involve URL fetching. Users are advised to upgrade to `gradio>=5` to address this issue.  As a workaround, users can disable or heavily restrict URL-based inputs in their Gradio applications to trusted domains only. Additionally, implementing stricter URL validation (such as allowinglist-based validation) and ensuring that local or internal network addresses cannot be requested via the `/queue/join` endpoint can help mitigate the risk of SSRF attacks.",0.0,,0.0,,"[{""source"": ""security-advisories@github.com"", ""type"": ""Secondary"", ""description"": [{""lang"": ""en"", ""value"": ""CWE-918""}]}]",[],"[{""url"": ""https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/security/advisories/GHSA-576c-3j53-r9jj"", ""source"": ""security-advisories@github.com""}]","['Linux', 'Windows', 'macOS']",,,server,,"{'contexts': [{'environment': 'Server-side deployment of Gradio applications', 'explanation': ""The SSRF vulnerability is specifically related to the Gradio server's ability to send HTTP requests to user-controlled URLs via the /queue/join endpoint.
